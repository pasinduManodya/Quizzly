   - Check if `.env` file exists and has correct values
   - Ensure MongoDB connection string is valid
   - Verify OpenAI API key is correct

2. **Frontend won't load**
   - Make sure backend is running on port 5000
   - Check if all dependencies are installed (`npm install` in both root and client directories)

3. **PDF upload fails**
   - Check file size (max 10MB)
   - Ensure file is a valid PDF
   - Check OpenAI API key and quota

4. **Database connection issues**
   - Verify MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure database user has proper permissions

### Getting Help
